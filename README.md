# Assignment 1 and 2 for SC4003 Intelligent Agents AY24/25 Sem 2

## Assignment 1

To run the code:

1. Ensure python is installed, either from the official installer
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>, or from a package manager. The python version I used
was version 3.13.2.
2. Either create a virtual environment and activate it, or just use the default global environment
3. Install the packages required to run the code by navigating to the folder and running “pip
install -r requirements.txt”
4. Finally, use python to execute the main.py file. Any constants for values of “c” and “k” can
be altered at the top of the program in main.py. The PART1_C_VALUE changes the optimal
value of c we will use for part 1, PART2_C_VALUE changes the optimal value of c we will
use for part 2 and PART2_K_VALUE changes the optimal value of k we will use for part 2.

## Assignment 2

The setting up of the environment along with the solution to the problem was implemented in java.

1. Ensure java is installed, either from OpenJDK, <https://openjdk.org/>, or OracleJDK,
<https://www.oracle.com/java/>. The java version I used is OpenJDK 23.0.2 2025-01-2.
2. To run any java file (in this case ThreePrisonersDilemma.java) , in unix terminal, type
javac ThreePrisonersDilemma.java and then java ThreePrisonersDilemma.
